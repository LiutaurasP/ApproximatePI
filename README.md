# ComputePI
In this repository you will find couple of ways to compute or approximate value of PI.

<b>First billion digits of PI:

Approaches I've tried so far (ranked by precision from worst to best):

1) Monte Carlo method (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELetCV_wX_c) <br> + : fun, can be visualised (TODO) <br> - : bad accuracy because of noise random numbers generate
2) Pi Series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqtqY5-atuo) <br> + : faster and more precise than Monte Carlo method <br> - : you can only do so much with this approach because of limitations of computer arithmetics
3) Inverse Tangent formula (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d1JEj3NtOw) <br> + : Very precise to the full double precision capacity. <br> - : 15 decimal places is all we can do, feels like using a calculator
